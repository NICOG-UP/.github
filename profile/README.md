# NICOG - Nature Inspired Computing Optimization Group (NICOG)

The NICOG research group focuses on solving real-world problems using machine learning and optimisation techniques that take analogies from nature such as genetic algorithms and neural networks. The current focus areas of the group included:

- Evolutionary Computation
- Hyper-heuristics
- Automated design of machine learning and search techniques
- Deep Learning
- Neurevolution

Some of the application areas that we are working in include:
- Operations research - scheduling, packing and logistics problem.
- Health - disease diagnoses from images and quantitive data.
- Agriculture - identification of species, identification and prediction of diseases.
- Broadcasting - optimization, classification and prediction problems.
- Education - intelligent tutoring systems, learning analytics, learning tools, automated assessment.
- Natural Language Processing
